# STRATAGEM PRACTICE ONLINE
Project is a clone of https://combustibletoast.github.io/. Instead of it being a game, you can choose 4 stratagems at a time to practice to help hone in your in game stratagem input times. Not much to it other than that
This project is to help players of Helldivers 2 hone their skills when it comes to putting in stratagems.
