# STRATAGEM PRACTICE ONLINE
Project is a clone of https://combustibletoast.github.io/. Instead of it being a game, you can choose 4 stratagems at a time to practice inputting the correct sequence in. Any good Helldiver knows that speed is key when requesting support. So go out there and spread democracy!
## FILES/FOLDERS
`index.html`: main document for styling and markup of the practice page  
`arrow_key_generator`: a document that is used for generating the json for arrow keys  
`Images`: contains all the assests (sounds, arrow key pngs, and stratagem icons)  
`data`: contains the json that is pulled in to synchronize the icons and key sequences for each stratagem
